### Description

I would like to share here my Scheduling System, this system is only a part of my High School Enrollment System and my College Enrollment System that consist of 8 modules(registrar,grader,controller,scheduler,checker/assessor, collector/cashier,administrator, and the Web Transcript).

This system covers timetable for a school, high-school or university. It uses a fast and efficient timetabling algorithm.

- Defines school directory, faculty members, subjects, subject prerequisites, composites, class room, class section, and schedule template.

- Defines course prospectus and course master list.

- Manages course offerings, reservations, class scheduling, and faculty teaching load.

- Monitors classroom utilization.

- Forecasts subject demand.

please fell free to use and PLEASE PLEASE DONT FORGET TO COMMENT "Thanks" if you find my System useful to you... But if u take it for granted.. maybe I'll take some steps to remove this post I will mean it this time.... =)
